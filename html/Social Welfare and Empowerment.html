The scheme aims to provide financial services such as savings accounts, remittances, credit, insurance, and pension to the unbanked population. By offering a zero-balance savings account with easy access to banking facilities, PMJDY aims to bring the marginalized sections of society into the formal banking system. The scheme also promotes direct benefit transfers (DBT) to ensure efficient delivery of subsidies and benefits to beneficiaries. As of the latest data, PMJDY has made significant strides, with millions of accounts opened across the country, particularly benefiting women and economically weaker sections.

          <h3>Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA)</h3>
             <p>The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) was enacted in 2005 to provide livelihood security to rural households by guaranteeing 100 days of wage employment in a financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. The primary objective of MGNREGA is to enhance the livelihood security of rural households by generating employment opportunities in rural areas, thereby reducing rural-urban migration. The scheme also aims to create durable assets and strengthen the social safety net for vulnerable sections of society, especially women, Scheduled Castes (SCs), and Scheduled Tribes (STs). MGNREGA has been instrumental in improving the socio-economic status of rural households by providing them with a stable source of income and empowering them to participate in local developmental activities. The official website of MGNREGA offers detailed information about the scheme's implementation, guidelines, operational processes, success stories, and grievance redressal mechanisms.

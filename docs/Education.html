          <h3>Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan</h3>
             <p>Launched in 2001 Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan(SSA) is
				one of India‟s major flagship programmes for universalisation of elementary education.
				Its overall goals include universal access and retention, bridging of gender and social
				category gaps in elementary education, and achieving significant enhancement in
				learning levels of children.
				SSA is being implemented in partnership with the State Governments and
				reaches out to 192 million children in 1.1 million habitations across the country.
				SSA Goals are (a) Enrolment of all children in school, Education Guarantee Centres,
				Alternative school; (b) Retention of all children till the upper primary stage; (c)
				Bridging of gender and social category gaps in enrolment, retention and learning; and
				(d) Ensuring that there is significant enhancement in the learning achievement levels
				of children at the primary and upper primary stage.
				Provisions of Right to Education Act are being implemented through SSA.
				Accordingly, norms have been revised / modified to align them with the requirement of
				RTE Act, 2009.

          <h3>Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya</h3>
             <p>KGBVs are residential upper primary
				schools for girls from SC, ST, OBC and Muslim communities. KGBVs are set up in areas
				of scattered habitations where schools are at great distances and are a challenge to
				the security of girls. This often compels girls to discontinue their education. KGBV
				addresses this through setting up residential schools, in the block itself. KGBVs
				reach out to :
				 Adolescent girls who are unable to go to regular schools.
				 Out of school girls in the 10+ age group who are unable to complete primary
				school.
				 Younger girls of migratory populations in difficult areas of scattered habitations
				that do not qualify for primary/upper primary schools.

          <h3>National Programme for Education of Girls at Elementary Level	(NPEGEL)</h3>
             <p>NPEGEL is implemented in educationally backward blocks (EBB) and
				addresses the needs of girls who are „in‟ as well as „out‟ of school. NPEGEL also
				reaches out to girls who are enrolled in school, but do not attend school regularly.
				NPEGEL emphasizes the responsibility of teachers to recognize vulnerable girls
				and pay special attention to bring them out of their state of vulnerability and prevent
				them from dropping out.
				Both NPEGEL and KGBV are expected to work in tandem to complement efforts
				under SSA to ensure „inclusion‟ of all girls and provide them „quality‟ education. While
				NPEGEL is designed to work through the day schools, KGBV establishes residential
				schooling facilities for the girls in remote areas that are un-served by upper primary
				schools or in areas with educational disadvantage amongst certain social groups.

		<h3>Mid-Day Meal Scheme (MDMS)</h3>
	   		<p>In keeping with the Constitutional
				provisions to raise the level of nutrition of children and enable them to develop in a
				healthy manner, the National Programme of Nutritional Support to Primary Education
				(NP-NSPE) was launched as a Centrally sponsored scheme in 1995. Commonly referred
				to as MDMS, this was expected to enhance enrolment, retention, attendance of
				children in schools apart from improving their nutritional levels. This was extended to
				upper primary (classes VI to VIII) children in 3,479 Economically Backwards blocks
				(EBBs) in 2007 and then universalised at the elementary level in the year 2008. The
				scheme is implemented through the States/UTs. MDMS is managed and implemented
				by School Management/Village Education Committees, Panchayati Raj Institutions, and
				Self-Help Groups. MDMS now includes madrasas and maktabs supported under the
				SSA as well as children under the National Child Labour Projects. A detailed survey of
				implementation of intended nutritional values including calorific value, protein
				inclusion, additional nutritional supplements and vitamins, as detailed in the scheme, 
				needs to be carried out to ensure that the nutrition scheme is implemented in both
				spirit and letter.

		<h3>The Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan</h3>
	   		<p>A Centrally sponsored scheme
				with a funding pattern of 75:25 between Centre and States (90:10 for Special Category
				and North Eastern States), was launched in 2009–10. The major objectives of the 
				RMSA are to (i) raise the minimum level of education to class X and universalise access
				to secondary education; (ii) ensure good-quality secondary education with focus on
				Science, Mathematics and English; and (iii) reduce the gender, social and regional gaps
				in enrolments, dropouts and improving retention. The interventions supported under
				RMSA included (i) upgrading of upper primary schools to secondary schools; (ii)
				strengthening of existing secondary schools; (iii) providing additional classrooms,
				science laboratories, libraries, computer rooms, art, craft and culture rooms, toilet
				blocks and water facilities in schools; (iv) providing in-service training of teachers; and
				(v) providing for major repairs of school buildings and residential quarters for teachers.
				Despite being launched in the third year of Plan, there was good progress under the
				RMSA during the Eleventh Plan (Table given below). Against a target of enrolling an
				additional 3.2 million students, 2.4 million additional students were enrolled in
				secondary schools during the Eleventh Plan period.

		<h3>Scheme for Setting up of 6000 Model Schools at Block Level</h3>
	   		<p>
			Scheme envisages providing quality education to talented rural children through setting
  			up 6000 model schools as benchmark of excellence at block level at the rate of one
			  school per block. The scheme was launched in 2008-09 and is being implemented
			  from 2009-10. The objectives are:
			<ul>
			 
				<li>  To have at least one good quality senior secondary school in every block.</li>
				<li>  To have a pace setting role.</li>
				<li>  To try out innovative curriculum and pedagogy</li>
				<li>  To be a model in infrastructure, curriculum, evaluation and school governance.</li>

		<h3>Scheme of Vocationalisation of Secondary Education at +2 level</h3>
	   		<p>Initiated in 1988, this centrally sponsored scheme of Vocationalisation of Secondary
				Education provides for diversification of educational opportunities so as to enhance
				individual employability, reduce the mismatch between demand and supply of skilled
				manpower and provides an alternative for those pursuing higher education10
				.
				Hence, it is important and would be implemented from class IX onwards, unlike
				the present provision for its implementation from class XI, and would be subsumed
				under RMSA. Vocational Education courses will be based on national occupation
				standard brought out by the Sector kill Councils (SSCs) that determine the minimum
				levels of competencies for various vocations. Academic qualifications would be
				assessed and certified by educational bodies and vocational skills would be assessed
				and certified by respective SSCs.
